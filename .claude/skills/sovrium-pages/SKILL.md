description: Use when creating, redesigning or polishing the pages of a Sovrium app — routes, layouts and page access, choosing and composing components, binding pages to table data or collections, forms, design tokens in the design block, dark mode and responsive behaviour, empty, error and loading states, and the words on the page. Triggers include "add a page", "make this page look better", "landing page", "dashboard", "list of records", "record detail page", "form", "dark mode", "mobile layout", "the design looks generic", and "rewrite the copy".

# Sovrium pages

A bare agent builds a Sovrium page the way it would build a React page: it invents a `hero` component that does not exist, writes colours inline, uses the removed `theme` block, binds nothing to data and hard-codes sample rows, leaves every list without an empty state, and ships the same centred-gradient landing page every model produces. In Sovrium a page is configuration: components come from a fixed catalogue, data comes from tables through bindings, and the look comes from the app's `design` block.

Run the core loop from `sovrium-app` underneath this skill: edit → `sovrium validate` → `sovrium start --watch` → browser → API.

## Routes and layouts

- Each entry in `pages` has a `name`, a `path` and `components`. Paths with a `:param` render one record. Manual: `sovrium docs pages/pages-routing`.
- Shared chrome (a sidebar, a header) belongs in a page `layout`, not copied into every page. Manual: `sovrium docs pages/pages-layouts-access`.
- `access` decides who may open a page: `all`, `authenticated`, a role list, or `{ require, redirectTo }`. A visitor who may not see a page gets 404.
- In a multilingual app, every page exists under each language prefix; see `sovrium docs app-schema/languages`.

## Picking components

- The catalogue is fixed and grouped by category; list it with `sovrium docs components` and read the category article, `sovrium docs components/<category>-components` (for example `layout-components`, `content-components`, `navigation-components`, `overlay-components`). Data components have their own section: `sovrium docs data-components`; form controls theirs: `sovrium docs form-controls`.
- There is **no `hero` type**, no `section` type, no `navbar` type. Compose them from `container`, `flex`, `grid`, `text`, `image`, `button` and `card`. An unknown type fails `sovrium validate` with the accepted list.
- Reusable pieces are declared once and referenced; see `sovrium docs components/reusable-components`.
- Every component type and option, generated from the binary: `references/component-catalogue.generated.md`.

## Binding data

- Lists, tables, cards, boards, calendars and charts read records through a data binding; never paste sample rows into a page. Manual: `sovrium docs pages/pages-data-binding`.
- A record page (`:param` path) binds one record; a collection generates one route per record or per markdown file. Manual: `sovrium docs pages/pages-collections`.
- Operational data that is not a table (the current user, runs, system lists) comes from system sources. Manual: `sovrium docs pages/system-sources`.
- A binding respects the table's permissions: what a visitor sees is what the API would give them. Test each page as the role it is for.

## Forms

- Forms are declared under the top-level `forms` list and placed on pages by name. Manual: `sovrium docs forms/forms-overview`.
- Who may submit is set on the form: `sovrium docs form-delivery/form-access`. Anti-spam, availability windows and file uploads are in the same section.
- Every field has a visible label, a helpful error message, and a success state that says what happens next.

## Design tokens

- Read the app's design brief before touching anything: `sovrium design-system` prints the resolved `design` block (tokens, principles, voice) as markdown.
- The live key is **`design`**: colours in `design.colors` (and `design.darkColors` for the dark scheme), type in `design.typeScale`, spacing in `design.spacing`, radius in `design.radius`. The old `theme` block is refused by `sovrium validate`, which names each replacement key. Manual: `sovrium docs theming/design` and `sovrium docs theming/theme`.
- Dark mode: `sovrium docs theming/theme-dark-mode`. Responsive behaviour: `sovrium docs theming/responsive-design`.
- Change a token once in `design`, never a colour inline on one component.
- The voice lives in `design.voice`; `design.voice.tone` says how it shifts from one moment to the next, including the confirmation of a destructive action (`sovrium docs config design.voice.tone`).

## Plan before you build

Write a short design plan before adding or changing a component: which mode this is (a new page, a refinement, or a redesign), what the app's `design` block already decides, the structure in greyscale, then type, spacing and layout, and colour last. A plan is cheap to change; a built page is not, and a page built without one drifts toward the generic defaults. The steps and the plan template: `references/design-plan.md`.

## States and forms

A page is not finished when its happy path renders. Every data component needs a first-use empty state, a no-results state, a loading state sized to the wait and an error that says what to do next; every form needs visible labels, errors beside the field that keep the visitor's input, and a success state. Dark mode fails in its own ways and has its own checks. The full checklist: `references/states-and-forms.md`.

## Copy

Words are part of the interface, written in the same pass as the layout and in the app's voice (`design.voice`), not yours. No word that is not doing work, but never cut the sentence that tells the visitor what happens next. One term per concept across the app. Voice, calls to action, labels, messages and the review checklist: `references/copy.md`.

## Critique: one bounded browser pass

The agent judges a page by using it in a browser, not by reading the config or a single
screenshot. It runs **one** batched inspection, fixes what it found in **one** batch, runs
**one** confirmation pass, and stops. It does not loop on taste.

### Before the pass

- Read the design brief (`sovrium design-system <config>`) again. A finding that contradicts the app's own principles, tokens or voice is not a finding; the author's system wins.
- Boot the app (`sovrium start --watch`) and validate the config (`sovrium validate`) so the pass runs against what will ship.

### The inspection (one pass, all of it)

Run every item on every changed page, collecting findings without fixing yet:

1. **Three widths**: 375 px, 768 px, 1280 px. Look for overflow, horizontal scroll, cramped or orphaned elements, and whether the hierarchy survives.
2. **Dark scheme**: switch scheme and repeat the dark-mode QA list (`references/states-and-forms.md`).
3. **Keyboard**: Tab through the page from the top; open and close every overlay; confirm visible focus and the APG keys (`references/accessibility.md`).
4. **States**: force each data component empty, no-results and error; submit each form empty and with bad input.
5. **Accessibility tree**: take a snapshot of the tree, not only pixels; check names, roles, heading order.
6. **Copy**: read every string against the review checklist in `references/copy.md`.
7. **Console**: note any errors or warnings the page logs.

### The record, one entry per issue

| Field        | Content                                                                    |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Heuristic    | Which of the ten heuristics below it breaks (or the WCAG criterion number) |
| Location     | Page route, component, and width or scheme where it shows                  |
| Impact       | What the visitor experiences, in one sentence                              |
| Severity     | Blocker, High, Medium or Nitpick (definitions below)                       |
| Smallest fix | The least change that resolves it, stated as a config edit                 |

Severity:

- **Blocker**: a visitor cannot complete the page's job, or an accessibility gate fails. Fix before anything else.
- **High**: the job completes but with confusion, error risk or clear inconsistency. Fix in this batch.
- **Medium**: friction a regular visitor notices. Fix in this batch if the fix is small; otherwise report it.
- **Nitpick**: polish. Report it; fix only if it is free.

### Fix, confirm, stop

- Apply all Blocker and High fixes, and the cheap Medium ones, in **one** batch of config edits; validate after the batch.
- Run **one** confirmation pass over only the recorded issues and the widths and schemes where they appeared.
- Stop. Report what was fixed, what remains (with severity), and any finding that needs a decision from the author or a capability the config cannot express.
- A fix that would contradict the app's `design` block is not applied; it is reported as a question to the author.

### The rubric: ten heuristics, as checks

| #   | Heuristic                                              | What the agent checks on a Sovrium page                                                                                                                                      |
| --- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | Visibility of system status                            | Every data component has a loading indicator sized to the wait; saves, imports and long tasks report progress and completion                                                 |
| 2   | Match between the system and the real world            | Labels use the visitor's words from the app's vocabulary table, not field names or internal ids; dates, numbers and currency in the locale's format                          |
| 3   | User control and freedom                               | Dialogs close with Escape and a visible control; destructive actions confirm or offer undo; filters have "Clear all"                                                         |
| 4   | Consistency and standards                              | One term per concept; the same action looks and reads the same on every page; components follow platform conventions                                                         |
| 5   | Error prevention                                       | Right control for the input (radio for five options or fewer, pickers for dates and records); constraints stated before submit; destructive actions separated from safe ones |
| 6   | Recognition rather than recall                         | Options visible instead of remembered; active filters shown; the current page marked in navigation                                                                           |
| 7   | Flexibility and efficiency of use                      | Keyboard paths for frequent actions; bulk actions on lists; density suited to repeated use                                                                                   |
| 8   | Aesthetic and minimalist design                        | Nothing on the page that is not doing work; no item from the anti-slop list the author did not ask for; one primary action                                                   |
| 9   | Help users recognise, diagnose and recover from errors | Every error says what, why and what next, beside its source, without colour alone, keeping the visitor's input                                                               |
| 10  | Help and documentation                                 | Hints beside complex fields; empty states that teach the one thing a first-time visitor needs; links to help where the task is genuinely complex                             |

## Verify

One bounded browser pass (see `sovrium-app`, `references/browser-loop.md`), then at most one confirmation pass:

```
- [ ] Three widths: 375, 768, 1280 px — no horizontal scroll, hierarchy intact
- [ ] Dark scheme — text and controls readable, no hard-coded light colours
- [ ] Keyboard — every control reachable, focus visible, overlays open and close
- [ ] Empty state — the page with no records says what to do next
- [ ] Error state — a failing binding or a rejected form shows a useful message
- [ ] As the intended role, and as one that should not see the page (expect 404)
- [ ] Console filtered for errors; failed requests listed
```

## Anti-patterns

- A `hero`, `section` or `navbar` component type (they do not exist; compose).
- Colours, sizes or fonts written on components instead of in `design`.
- A `theme` block.
- Sample rows typed into a page instead of a data binding.
- A list, table or board with no empty state.
- A page gated by hiding a link instead of by `access`.
- The same shared chrome copied into every page instead of a `layout`.
- Judging a page from the config or from one desktop screenshot.
