# catgo

A [Sovrium](https://sovrium.com) application — a self-hosted, **configuration-driven**
platform. The entire app (data model, auth, pages, design, i18n) is declared in one or more
YAML config files (a single `app.yaml` to start, split via `$ref` as the app grows) and
served by the `sovrium` runtime. There is no hand-written
server or UI code to maintain.

## Documentation

The Sovrium manual ships inside the binary. Where you read it depends on whether you can
run commands.

**With a shell** (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, a terminal), `sovrium docs` is the manual for
the version you run, so it can never describe a different one. Start there:

```bash
sovrium docs                   # The table of contents
sovrium docs search <words>    # Find the article covering a topic
sovrium docs <section>/<slug>  # Read it
sovrium docs config <path>     # Look one option up (e.g. tables[].fields[].type)
sovrium docs env <NAME>        # Look one environment variable up
sovrium docs cli <verb>        # Look one command up
sovrium schema                 # The full JSON Schema of this binary
```

**Agent skills.** `.claude/skills/` holds the skills written by `sovrium skills` for the
version in this project: start from `sovrium-app` for any change to the config. After
upgrading Sovrium, run `sovrium skills` again to refresh them — a file you edited is kept
unless you pass `--force`. For Codex, Copilot, Gemini CLI or OpenCode, run
`sovrium skills --target agents` to write them to `.agents/skills/` as well.

**If your client cannot run commands** (for example Claude Desktop connected through
`sovrium mcp`, whose tools edit the config but serve no documentation), read the published
copy instead:

- **Start at the index:** `https://sovrium.com/llms.txt` — a plain-text list of every published
  page, one titled line each with a short description. Pick a page from there instead of
  guessing a slug.
- **Fetch that page with `.md` appended.** Every docs page has a raw-markdown twin:
  `https://sovrium.com/en/docs/configuration-refs.md` is about 3.8 KB against 121 KB for the
  same page as HTML. Always take the `.md`.
- **Never fetch `https://sovrium.com/llms-full.txt`** — the entire corpus in one file, roughly
  3 MB; a single call floods the context window. Use the index, one page at a time.
- The index carries English and French — prefer `/en/…`, switch to `/fr/…` for a French user.

That copy describes the latest release, which may not be the one in this project. Compare
with `sovrium --version`, or with the version the MCP server reports when it connects.

Where sources disagree, the binary wins: `sovrium docs` and `sovrium schema` describe the one
you are actually running, the website describes the latest release, and pretrained knowledge
of Sovrium may describe an older one.

## How to work in this project (read first)

- **Edit `app.yaml`, not application code.** Features are added declaratively by editing
  the config, not by writing TypeScript/React/SQL. Prefer a schema change over new code.
- **Validate before running:** `sovrium validate app.yaml` checks the config against the
  schema and reports errors with paths. Always validate after editing.
- **Start with the minimum, grow as needed.** The schema supports progressive complexity —
  add tables, pages, auth, and design incrementally.
- **The authoritative contract is the schema itself:** run `sovrium schema` to print the
  full JSON Schema (Draft 2020-12) for `app.yaml`. When unsure about a property or field type,
  consult the schema rather than guessing.

## Commands

```bash
sovrium start app.yaml         # Run the app (dev server)
sovrium start app.yaml --watch # Hot-reload on config changes
sovrium validate app.yaml      # Validate the config against the schema
sovrium schema                 # Print the full JSON Schema for app.yaml
sovrium build app.yaml         # Build static output
sovrium mcp --project .        # Serve this config to your AI client (MCP, stdio)
```

## Connecting your AI client

`sovrium mcp --project .` serves this project's configuration to Claude Desktop, Claude Code
or Cursor over stdio. Point your client at it — command `sovrium`, arguments
`mcp --project <this directory>` — and the assistant editing `app.yaml` can read the config
as it stands, validate what it just wrote, consult the schema at a given path, and see
whether a running instance took the last save, instead of guessing from a file it has not
seen. It starts no server: there is no token to configure and no `auth:` block to add.

Those four tools are read-only unless you set `MCP_CONFIG_WRITE=1`. It is off by default, and
it is an environment variable rather than a config key on purpose — a config file must not be
able to authorise its own editing. Set it, name this directory explicitly, and four more
tools appear: the assistant can list the files your config is made of, read one, replace one,
and undo its last change.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sovrium": {
      "command": "sovrium",
      "args": ["mcp", "--project", "/absolute/path/to/this/project"],
      "env": { "MCP_CONFIG_WRITE": "1" }
    }
  }
}
```

Writing is bounded rather than trusted. Edits stay inside this directory and touch only
`.yaml`, `.yml` and `.json` files — never `.env`, `.git/`, `.claude/` or the data directory.
A file that changed on disk since the assistant read it is refused rather than overwritten,
and a change that would not decode as a valid config never reaches the disk. Dropping a
column needs `allowDestructive: true`, which the assistant is never allowed to set for you.
Every change is snapshotted first, so `undo` always has a way back.

## Reviewing changes in the browser

Validating is not verifying. After a config change, boot the app and drive it:

- `sovrium start app.yaml --watch` serves the app at `http://localhost:3000` (override with
  `PORT`) and hot-reloads on every save.
- Drive that running instance with Claude in Chrome — the `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.
  They are deferred: load them in one batched `ToolSearch`, call `tabs_context_mcp` first, open
  a **new** tab with `tabs_create_mcp`, and close what you opened.
- **Exercise the workflow, not just the page.** Sign in, create a record, submit the form, let
  the automation fire — then check the **effect** (the row is there, the status changed), never
  just that something rendered.
- Because `--watch` hot-reloads, the loop is: edit the config, re-navigate, re-verify. Repeat
  until the workflow passes.
- Never trigger `alert()` / `confirm()` / `prompt()` — a JS dialog freezes the extension. If
  Chrome is not connected, or calls keep failing, say so and stop rather than reporting a
  change as verified when nothing was driven.

## Scaling the config

Start with a single `app.yaml`. As the app grows, split using `$ref`.
The rule is **one purpose per file** — if you can't describe a file
in one short sentence, it's mixing concerns and wants a split.

The canonical layout is **one file per entity for collections, one file
per singleton for scoped config**. Reach for it as soon as a collection
has more than one member; don't pre-split a single-table or single-page app.

```
app.yaml                              # entry point — stays at the project root
config/design.yaml                    # singleton — all design tokens
config/auth.yaml                      # singleton — auth config
config/i18n.yaml                      # singleton — all i18n strings
config/analytics.yaml                 # singleton — analytics
config/tables/contacts.yaml           # one file per table
config/tables/orders.yaml
config/pages/landing.yaml             # one file per page
config/pages/dashboard.yaml
config/components/icon-badge.yaml     # one file per reusable component template
config/automations/on-new-order.yaml  # one file per automation
config/forms/contact-us.yaml          # one file per standalone form
config/buckets/uploads.yaml           # one file per bucket
config/connections/stripe.yaml        # one file per connection
config/agents/support-bot.yaml        # one file per AI agent
config/actions/send-slack.yaml        # one file per reusable action template
```

In `app.yaml`: `design: { $ref: './config/design.yaml' }`. Collections list
their entities: `tables: [{ $ref: './config/tables/contacts.yaml' }, …]`.
Paths resolve relative to the file containing the `$ref`.

**Root keys fall into three shapes** — split accordingly:

- **Collections** (`tables`, `pages`, `forms`, `components`, `connections`,
  `actions`, `automations`, `agents`, `buckets`, `env`) → one file per entity
  under `config/<collection>/`.
- **Singletons** (`auth`, `design`, `analytics`, `languages`, `scripts`) →
  one file per singleton at `config/<singleton>.yaml`. Never split
  these by sub-key.
- **Scalars** (`name`, `version`, `description`) → stay inline in `app.yaml`.

**When to start splitting** — once any collection has 2+ members, move that
collection to per-entity files in the same authoring pass. Below that
threshold (a single table, a single page) keep it inline — the indirection
cost isn't worth it. A single logical entity past ~300 lines is itself a
signal to split sub-concerns (e.g. a complex table's `fields` into a sidecar),
but that's a secondary split, not the primary one.

Note: reusable **component templates** are root entities (their own files);
page-instance components stay inside the page file.

Prefer YAML for readability; switch to a `.ts` config if you want IDE
autocompletion and compile-time type-checking. Run `sovrium types` to write
`sovrium.d.ts` and a `tsconfig.json` beside your config — no `package.json`,
no `node_modules`, no install step — then author `app.ts` like this:

```ts
import type { AppConfig } from 'sovrium'

export default {
  name: 'my-app',
} satisfies AppConfig
```

The import MUST be `import type`, and the object MUST be checked with
`satisfies` rather than constructed by a helper function. The runtime does not
resolve bare-package specifiers, so a value import (the old `defineConfig()`
shape) type-checks and then fails to boot; `import type` is erased before the
runtime ever looks. Re-run `sovrium types` after upgrading the binary.

## The `app.yaml` schema

Root properties include: `name`, `description`, `tables`, `auth`, `pages`, `design`,
`i18n`, `analytics`, `connections`, and `agents`. Highlights:

- **`tables`** — your data model. Each table has `fields`; field `type` spans many
  categories (text, number, date/time, select, relation, attachment, rich-text, code,
  formula, AI-compute, …). The runtime generates the database, REST API, and CRUD UI.
- **Field `id`s** — set one on every field. An omitted id means "position in the list", so
  inserting a field above another one shifts every id after it, and the migration diff reads
  that shift as a rename of fields nobody renamed. Keep the ids a field already has; give a
  new field the next unused number.
- **`auth`** — authentication (email/password, magic link, OAuth) plus role-based access
  (`admin`, `member`, `viewer`) and field-level permissions.
- **`pages`** — composed from many built-in component types (forms, tables, kanban,
  calendar, charts, rich content, …). Server-rendered.
- **`design`** — colors, typeScale, spacing, radius, elevation, motion, breakpoints.
- **`i18n`** — multi-language content (RTL supported).

## Runtime data

On `sovrium start`, runtime artifacts are written under `.sovrium/` (git-ignored):
the zero-config SQLite database (`database.db`), the server lock file, and local file
storage. Set `DATABASE_URL` to use PostgreSQL instead. Relocate the whole folder with
the `SOVRIUM_DATA_DIR` env var. Operator settings live in **environment variables**, not
in `app.yaml`.
